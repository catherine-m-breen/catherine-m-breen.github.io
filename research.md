## Evaluating camera traps as ground-based remote sensing networks linking snow and wildlife
Optical satellite instruments provide large-scale observations of snow cover, but cloud cover and dense forest canopy can reduce accuracy in mapping snow cover. Remote camera networks deployed for wildlife monitoring operate below cloud cover and in forests, representing a virtually untapped source of snow cover observations to supplement satellite observations. Using images from 1181 wildlife cameras deployed by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), we compared snow cover extracted from camera images to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products during winter months of 2018â€“2020.

## Snow Depth from Snow Poles 
Snow pole time-lapse photography, in which a snow pole of a known height is installed in front of a camera and photographed repeatedly over the course of a snow season, allows a large network of sites to be established relatively quickly and affordably. However, current approaches for extracting snow depth information from these snow poles typically relies on time intensive manual photo processing. My work focuses on automating the process to faciliate expansion of timelapse photography for snow depth analysis.

## Hourly changes in snow and wildlife behavior
My current is focusing on the surface of the snow (whether it is hard or soft) as well as storms. I am currently interested in how hourly changes in the snow surface impact animal diurnal cycles.
